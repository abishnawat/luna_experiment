1
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,559
Aargh!

2
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,879
Aaargh!

3
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,679
Dear Santa, thank you
for the dolls and pencils and the fish.

4
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,279
It's Easter now,
so I hope I didn't wake you.

5
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,839
But honest, it is an emergency.

6
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,679
There's a crack in my wall.

7
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,959
Aunt Sharon says
it's just an ordinary crack, but...

8
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,879
I know it's not, because...
at night, there's voices.

9
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,279
So please, please,
could you send someone to fix it?

10
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,519
Or a policeman. Or...

11
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,959
Back in a moment.

12
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,279
Thank you, Santa.

13
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,799
Can I have an apple?

14
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,919
All I can think about - apples.

15
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,599
I love apples.
Maybe I'm having a craving.

16
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,279
That's new -
never had cravings before.

17
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,919
Whoa!

18
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,119
Look at that!

19
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,039
Are you OK?

20
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,839
Just had a fall. All the way down there,
right to the library.

21
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,079
Hell of a climb back up.

22
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,719
- You're soaking wet.
- I was in the swimming pool.

23
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,239
- You said you were in the library.
- So was the swimming pool.

24
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,759
- Are you a policeman?
- Why?

25
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,079
Did you call a policeman?

26
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,679
Did you come about
the crack in my wall?

27
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,919
What cra...? Argh!

28
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,599
Are you all right, mister?

29
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,119
No, I'm fine, it's OK.

30
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,599
This is all perfectly norm...

31
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,559
Who are you?

32
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,119
I don't know yet. I'm still cooking.

33
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,439
Does it scare you?

34
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,359
No, it just looks a bit weird.

35
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,319
No, no, no. The crack in your wall.

36
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,839
- Does it scare you?
- Yes.

37
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,679
Well, then, no time to lose.

38
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,039
I'm the Doctor.
Do everything I tell you,

39
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,359
don't ask stupid questions
and don't wander off.

40
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,359
Are you all right?

41
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,719
Early days.

42
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,639
Steering's a bit off.

43
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,279
If you're a doctor,
why does your box say Police?

44
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,759
That's disgusting. What is that?

45
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,879
- An apple.
- Apples are rubbish. I hate apples.

46
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,319
You said you loved them.

47
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,399
No, no, I love yoghurt. Yoghurt's
my favourite. Give me yoghurt.

48
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,439
I hate yoghurt,
it's just stuff with bits in.

49
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,479
- You said it was your favourite.
- New mouth, new rules.

50
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,359
It's like eating after cleaning your
teeth, everything tastes...wro-agh!

51
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,559
What is it? What's wrong with you?

52
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,119
Wrong with me? It's not my fault.

53
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,839
Why can't you give me decent food?
You're Scottish - fry something.

54
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,879
Ah! Bacon!

55
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,839
Bacon.

56
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,479
That's bacon.

57
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,119
Are you trying to poison me?

58
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,399
Ah. You see? Beans.

59
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,519
Beans are evil. Bad, bad beans.

60
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,399
Bread and butter.

61
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,959
Now you're talking.

62
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,519
And stay out!

63
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,439
We've got some carrots.

64
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,039
Carrots? Are you insane?
No, wait, hang on.

65
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,079
I know what I need.
I need...I need...I need...

66
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,239
fish fingers and custard.

67
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,399
- Funny.
- Am I?

68
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,239
Good. Funny's good.

69
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,559
- What's your name?
- Amelia Pond.

70
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,279
Ah, that's a brilliant name.

71
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,119
"Amelia Pond",
like a name in a fairy tale.

72
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,319
Are we in Scotland, Amelia?

73
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,479
No. Had to move to England.

74
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,679
It's rubbish.

75
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,119
So what about your mum and dad, then?
Are they upstairs?

76
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,879
- Thought we'd have woken them by now.
- I don't have a mum and dad.

77
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,159
Just an aunt.

78
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,919
I don't even have an aunt.

79
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,599
You're lucky.

80
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,519
I know.

81
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,399
So, your aunt.

82
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,679
Where is she?

83
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,359
She's out.

84
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,799
And she left you all alone?

85
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,439
- I'm not scared.
- You're not scared of anything!

86
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,959
Box falls out of the sky, man falls
out of box, man eats fish custard,

87
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,759
and look at you,
just sitting there.

88
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,599
- So you know what I think?
- What?

89
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,919
Must be a hell of a scary crack
in your wall.

90
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,679
You've had some cowboys in here.

91
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,559
Not actual cowboys,

92
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,599
though that can happen.

93
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,559
I used to hate apples,
so my mum put faces on them.

94
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,479
She sounds good, your mum.
I'll keep it for later.

95
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,039
This wall is solid and the crack
doesn't go all the way through it.

96
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,759
So here's a thing -
where's the draught coming from?

97
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,799
Wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey.
You know what the crack is?

98
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,879
What?

99
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,119
It's a crack.

100
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,759
I'll tell you something funny.
If you knocked this wall down,

101
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,039
the crack would stay put,
cos the crack isn't in the wall.

102
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,159
- Where is it, then?
- Everywhere.

103
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,359
In everything. It's a split
in the skin of the world.

104
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,519
Two parts of space and time
that should never have touched,

105
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,399
pressed together...

106
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,199
...right here in the wall
of your bedroom.

107
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,639
- Sometimes, can you hear...?
- A voice.

108
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,439
Yes.

109
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,519
Prisoner Zero has escaped.

110
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,479
- Prisoner Zero?
- "Prisoner Zero has escaped."

111
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,959
That's what I heard.
What does it mean?

112
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,599
Prisoner Zero has escaped.

113
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,719
It means that, on the other side
of this wall, there's a prison

114
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,479
and they've lost a prisoner.
Do you know what that means?

115
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,279
- What?
- You need a better wall.

116
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,199
The only way to close the breach
is to open it all the way.

117
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,879
The forces will invert
and it'll snap itself shut.

118
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,359
- Or...
- What?

119
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,119
You know when grown-ups tell you
everything's going to be fine

120
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,919
and you think they're probably lying
to make you feel better?

121
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,119
Yes.

122
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,439
Everything's going to be fine.

123
00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:00,359
Prisoner Zero has escaped.

124
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,359
Hello?

125
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,919
Hello!

126
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,439
What's that?

127
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,799
There. You see, told you it would close.
Good as new.

128
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,199
What was that thing?
Was that Prisoner Zero?

129
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,119
No. I think that was
Prisoner Zero's guard.

130
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,279
Whatever it was, it sent me
a message. Psychic paper -

131
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,799
takes a lovely little message.

132
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,439
"Prisoner Zero has escaped."

133
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,999
But why tell us?

134
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,039
Unless...

135
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,319
Unless what?

136
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,559
Unless Prisoner Zero
escaped through here.

137
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,839
But he couldn't have.

138
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,639
We'd know.

139
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,239
It's difficult.
Brand-new me, nothing works yet.

140
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,719
But there's something
I'm missing...

141
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,999
...in the corner...

142
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,119
...of my eye.

143
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,639
No, no, no, no, no, no!

144
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,719
I've got to get back in there.

145
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,999
The engines are phasing.
It's going to burn!

146
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,199
But...

147
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,239
...it's just a box!

148
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,559
- How can a box have engines?
- It's not a box.

149
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,359
It's a time machine.

150
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,399
What, a real one?

151
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,679
You've got a real time machine?

152
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,919
Not for much longer
if I can't get her stabilised.

153
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,279
Five-minute hop into the future
should do it.

154
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,759
Can I come?

155
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,999
Not safe in here, not yet. Five minutes.
Give me five minutes.

156
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,399
I'll be right back.

157
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,399
People always say that.

158
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,359
Am I people?

159
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,079
Do I even look like people?

160
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,839
Trust me.

161
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,399
I'm the Doctor.

162
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,279
Geronimo!

163
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,519
Amelia!

164
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,319
Amelia, I worked out what it was.
I know what I was missing!

165
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,879
You've got to get out of there!

166
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,839
Amelia?

167
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,679
Amelia, are you all right?
Are you there?

168
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,399
Prisoner Zero is here.

169
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,559
Prisoner Zero is here!
Prisoner Zero is here!

170
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,079
Do you understand me?
Prisoner Zero is...

171
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,999
So...they all called out at once,
that's what you're saying?

172
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,159
All of them, all the coma patients.

173
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,919
You do understand that these people
are all comatose, don't you?

174
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,439
- They can't speak.
- Yes, Dr Ramsden.

175
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,519
Then why are you wasting my time?

176
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,399
- Because they called for you.
- Me?

177
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,719
Doctor.

178
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,999
Doctor.

179
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,159
Doctor. Doctor...

180
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,039
Doctor... Doctor...

181
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,079
Doctor... Doctor...

182
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,879
Doctor...!

183
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,359
White male, mid-20s,
breaking and entering.

184
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,759
Send me some back-up,
I've got him restrained.

185
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,439
Oi, you! Sit still.

186
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,519
Cricket bat.
I'm getting cricket bat.

187
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,439
You were breaking and entering.

188
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,959
That's much better.

189
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,039
Brand-new me, whack on the head.
Just what it needed.

190
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,759
Do you want to shut up now?
I've got back-up on the way.

191
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,079
Hang on, wait -
you're a policewoman.

192
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,599
You're breaking and entering.
See how this works?

193
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,519
What are you doing here?
Where's Amelia?

194
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,599
Amelia Pond?

195
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,719
Yeah. Amelia. Little Scottish girl.
Where is she?

196
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,479
I promised her five minutes
but the engines were phasing.

197
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:46,279
I suppose I must have gone a bit far.
Has something happened to her?

198
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,079
Amelia Pond hasn't lived here
in a long time.

199
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,519
How long?

200
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,879
- Six months.
- No!

201
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,999
No, no, no!
I can't be six months late!

202
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,799
I said five minutes. I promised.

203
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,639
What happened to her?
What happened to Amelia Pond?

204
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,079
Sarge, it's me again. Hurry it up.

205
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,279
This guy knows something
about Amelia Pond.

206
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,239
I don't think they were even conscious.

207
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,439
Dr Ramsden, there is another
sort of, um...funny thing.

208
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,439
Yes, I know. Dr Carver told me
about your conversation.

209
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,879
We've been very patient with you, Rory.
You're a good nurse, but for God's sake!

210
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,399
I've seen them.

211
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,719
These patients are under
24-hour supervision!

212
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,559
We know if their blood pressure changes.

213
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,119
There's no possibility
you'd have seen them

214
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,439
wandering in the village!
Why are you giving me your phone?!

215
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,559
It's a camera too.

216
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,559
You need to take some time off, Rory.
A lot of time off.

217
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,279
Start now.

218
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,639
Now!

219
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,439
I need to speak to whoever lives
in this house right now.

220
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,239
- I live here.
- But you're the police.

221
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,519
And this is where I live!
You got a problem with that?

222
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,359
How many rooms?

223
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,479
- I'm sorry, what?
- On this floor.

224
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,799
How many rooms on this floor?
Count them.

225
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,919
Why?

226
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,839
Because it will change your life.

227
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,999
Five.

228
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,159
- One, two, three, four, five.
- Six.

229
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,959
- Six?
- Look.

230
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,439
- Look where?
- Exactly where you never want to look.

231
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,839
The corner of your eye. Look behind you.

232
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,119
That's... That is not possible.

233
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,759
How's that possible?

234
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,399
There's a perception filter all round
the door. Sensed it last time I was here.

235
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,599
Should've seen it.

236
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,719
But that's a whole room. That's
a whole room I've never even noticed.

237
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,879
The filter stops you noticing.
Something came here a while ago to hide.

238
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,919
It's still hiding
and you need to uncuff me now!

239
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,239
- I don't have the key. I lost it.
- How can you have lost it?!

240
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,679
Stay away from that door!

241
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,159
Do not touch that door!

242
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,719
Listen to me! Do not open that...

243
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,399
Why does no-one ever listen to me?

244
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,119
Do I just have a face
that nobody listens to?

245
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,559
Again?

246
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,079
My screwdriver, where is it? Silver thing,
blue at the end. Where did it go?

247
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,319
- There's nothing here.
- Whatever's in there stopped you seeing

248
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,239
the whole room -
what makes you think you could see it?

249
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,439
Now, please, just get out!

250
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,719
- Silver, blue at the end?
- My screwdriver, yeah.

251
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,919
It's here.

252
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,959
Must have rolled under the door.

253
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,119
Yeah. Must have.

254
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,999
And then it must have jumped up
on the table.

255
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,279
Get out of there.

256
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,559
Get out of there!

257
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,119
Get out!

258
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,479
Get out of there!

259
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,319
What is it? What are you doing?

260
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,959
There's nothing here, but...

261
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,399
Corner of your eye.

262
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,319
What is it?

263
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,759
Don't try to see it. If it knows
you've seen it, it will kill you.

264
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,719
Don't look at it.

265
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,799
Do not...look.

266
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,279
Get out!

267
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,319
Give me that!

268
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,239
Come on. What's the bad alien done to you?

269
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,519
- Will that door hold it?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, course!

270
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,079
It's an inter-dimensional multi-form
from outer space -

271
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,399
they're all terrified of wood !

272
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,879
What's that? What's it doing?

273
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,959
I don't know. Getting dressed?
Run. Just go.

274
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,719
- Your back-up's coming, I'll be fine.
- There is no back-up.

275
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,639
- I heard you call for back-up.
- It's a pretend radio.

276
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,919
- But you're a policewoman.
- I'm a kissogram!

277
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,639
- But it's just...
- No, it isn't.

278
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,959
Look at the faces.

279
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,359
What? I'm sorry, but what?!

280
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,599
It's all one creature.
One creature disguised as two.

281
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,679
Clever old multi-form.

282
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,519
A bit of a rush job, though.
Got the voice a bit muddled, did you?

283
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,039
Mind you, where did you get
the pattern from?

284
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,999
You'd need a psychic link, a live feed.
How did you fix that?

285
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,959
Stay, boy!

286
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,919
Her and me, we're safe.
Want to know why? She sent for back-up.

287
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,519
I didn't send for back-up!

288
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,439
I know. That was a clever lie to save
our lives. OK, yeah, no back-up!

289
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,599
That's why we're safe.
Alone, we're not a threat to you.

290
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,279
If we had back-up,
then you'd have to kill us!

291
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,639
Attention, Prisoner Zero.
The human residence is surrounded.

292
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,759
- Attention Prisoner Zero...
- What's that?

293
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,639
- ...the human residence is surrounded.
- That would be back-up. OK,

294
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,479
one more time. We do have back-up
and that's definitely why we're safe.

295
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,079
Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence,

296
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,639
or the human residence
will be incinerated.

297
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,239
Safe apart from,
you know, incineration.

298
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,639
Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence,

299
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,479
- or the human residence will be...
- Wait, come on.

300
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,879
Prisoner Zero will vacate the human
residence, or the human residence

301
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,599
will be incinerated.

302
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,119
Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence,

303
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,399
- or the human residence will be...
- Run!

304
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,279
...the human residence, or the human
residence will be incinerated.

305
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,039
- Kissogram?
- Yes, a kissogram!

306
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,839
Why do you pretend
to be a policewoman?

307
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,879
You broke into my house!
It was this or a French maid!

308
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,639
What's going on? Tell me!

309
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,239
Tell me!

310
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,639
An alien convict is hiding in your spare
room disguised as a man and a dog,

311
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,399
and some other aliens are about to
incinerate your house. Any questions?

312
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,519
- Yes.
- Me, too.

313
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,559
No, no, no! Don't do that, not now!
It's still rebuilding, not letting us in!

314
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,559
Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence...

315
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,959
Come on!

316
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,959
No, wait, hang on, hang on,
wait, wait, wait. The shed.

317
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,919
I destroyed that shed last time
I was here, smashed it to pieces.

318
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,559
- So there's a new one. Let's go.
- But the new one's got old.

319
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,839
It's ten years old at least.

320
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,119
1 2 years. I'm not six months late,
I'm 1 2 years late.

321
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,759
- He's coming.
- You said six months.

322
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,519
- Why did you say six months?
- We've got to go.

323
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,159
This matters. This is important.
Why did you say six months?

324
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,679
Well,
why did you say five minutes?!

325
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,719
- What?
- Come on.

326
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,559
What?

327
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,439
- Come on!
- What?

328
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,359
Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence,

329
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,239
or the human residence
will be incinerated.

330
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,359
- You're Amelia.
- You're late.

331
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,439
- Amelia Pond. You're the little girl.
- I'm Amelia and you're late.

332
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,519
- What happened?
- 1 2 years.

333
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,679
- You hit me with a cricket bat.
- 1 2 years.

334
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,359
- A cricket bat.
- 1 2 years and four psychiatrists.

335
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,079
- Four?
- I kept biting them.

336
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,039
- Why?
- They said you weren't real.

337
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,919
Prisoner
Zero will vacate the human residence,

338
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,519
or the human residence
will be incinerated. Repeat...

339
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,479
No, no, no, come on.

340
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,039
What? We're being staked out
by an ice-cream van?

341
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,239
Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence...

342
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,479
What's that?
Why are you playing that?

343
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,919
It's supposed to be Clair De Lune.

344
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,039
Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence,

345
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,199
or the human residence
will be incinerated. Repeat,

346
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,999
Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence,

347
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,319
or the human residence
will be incinerated. Repeat...

348
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,679
Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence...

349
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,879
...or the human residence
will be incinerated.

350
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,839
Doctor, what's happening?

351
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,279
Repeat, Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence,

352
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,159
or the human residence
will be incinerated.

353
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,519
Repeat, Prisoner Zero
will vacate the human residence,

354
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,119
or the human residence
will be incinerated.

355
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,759
Hello! Sorry to burst in,

356
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,039
we're doing a special on television
faults in this area. ...Also, crimes.

357
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,119
- Let's have a look.
- I was just about to phone.

358
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,519
It's on every channel.

359
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,079
Hello, Amy, dear.
Are you a policewoman now?

360
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,599
- Well, sometimes...
- I thought you were a nurse.

361
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,759
I can be a nurse.

362
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,959
- Or, actually, a nun?
- I dabble.

363
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,919
Amy, who is your friend?

364
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,079
- Who's Amy? You were Amelia.
- Yeah, now I'm Amy.

365
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,399
Amelia Pond - that was a great name.

366
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,799
Bit fairy tale.

367
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,599
I know you, don't I?

368
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,519
I've seen you somewhere before.

369
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,519
Not me. Brand-new face...

370
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,559
First time on.
And what sort of job's a kissogram?

371
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,599
I go to parties and I kiss people.

372
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,719
With outfits. It's a laugh.

373
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,279
- You were a little girl five minutes ago.
- You're worse than my aunt.

374
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,599
I'm the Doctor,
I'm worse than everybody's aunt.

375
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,839
And that is not
how I'm introducing myself.

376
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,839
Repetez, le Prisonnier...
...Zero wird der menschliche...

377
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,719
OK, so it's everywhere,
in every language.

378
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,679
They're broadcasting
to the whole world.

379
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,239
What's up there?
What are you looking for?

380
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,839
OK, planet this size, two poles,
your basic molten core...

381
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,639
they're going to need
a 40% fission blast.

382
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,119
But they'll have to power up first,
won't they?

383
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,959
So assuming a medium-sized starship,
that's 20 minutes.

384
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,879
What do you think? 20 minutes?

385
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,759
Yeah, 20 minutes.

386
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,599
We've got 20 minutes.

387
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,359
- 20 minutes to what?
- Are you the Doctor?

388
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,279
He is, isn't he? He's the Doctor!
The Raggedy Doctor.

389
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,479
All those cartoons you did,
when you were little.

390
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,559
The Raggedy Doctor - it's him.

391
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,319
Shut up.

392
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,559
Cartoons?

393
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,159
Gran, it's him, isn't it?

394
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,479
- It's really him!
- Jeff, shut up! 20 minutes to what?

395
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,799
...human residence
will be incinerated. Repeat...

396
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,959
The human residence.
They're not talking about your house,

397
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,079
they're talking about the planet.
Somewhere up there, there's a spaceship.

398
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,319
And it's going to incinerate the planet.

399
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,439
...will be incinerated. Repeat, Prisoner
Zero will vacate the human residence,

400
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,559
- or the human residence will be...
- 20 minutes to the end of the world.

401
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,839
...residence will be incinerated.
Repeat,

402
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,479
Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence,

403
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,919
or the human residence
will be incinerated.

404
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,679
Repeat, Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence,

405
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,879
or the human residence
will be incinerated.

406
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,199
- What is this place? Where am I?
- Leadworth.

407
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,959
- Where's the rest of it?
- This is it.

408
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,559
- Is there an airport?
- No.

409
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,839
- A nuclear power station?
- No.

410
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,279
- Even a little one?
- No.

411
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,199
- Nearest city?
- Gloucester, half an hour by car.

412
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,479
We don't have half an hour.
Do we have a car?

413
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,559
- No.
- Well, that's good! Fantastic, that is!

414
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,079
20 minutes to save the world
and I've got a post office. And it's shut!

415
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,799
What is that?

416
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,319
It's a duck pond.

417
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,479
- Why aren't there any ducks?
- I don't know. There's never any ducks.

418
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,399
Then how do you know it's a duck pond?

419
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,719
It just is.
Is it important, the duck pond?

420
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,359
I don't know. Why would I know?

421
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,959
This is too soon.

422
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,479
I'm not ready, I'm not done yet.

423
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,239
What's happening?
Why's it going dark?

424
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,159
- So what's wrong with the sun?
- Nothing.

425
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,039
You're looking at it
through a force-field.

426
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,159
They've sealed off
your upper atmosphere,

427
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,879
now they're getting ready
to boil the planet.

428
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,679
Oh, and here they come -
the human race.

429
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,239
The end comes, as it was
always going to - down a video phone!

430
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,959
This isn't real, is it?

431
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,759
- This is some kind of big wind-up.
- Why would I wind you up?

432
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,879
- You told me you had a time machine.
- And you believed me.

433
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,439
Then I grew up.

434
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,159
Oh, you never want to do that.
No, hang on, shut up, wait!

435
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,719
I missed it. I saw it
and I missed it. What did I see?

436
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,719
I saw... What did I see?

437
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,959
20 minutes.

438
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,479
I can do it.

439
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,119
20 minutes, the planet burns.

440
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,999
Run to your loved ones and say goodbye,
or stay and help me.

441
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,559
- No.
- I'm sorry?

442
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,879
No!

443
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,199
Amy, no, no, what are you doing?

444
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,359
Are you out of your mind?

445
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,439
- Who are you?
- You know who I am.

446
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,919
No, really, who are you?

447
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,159
Look at the sky!
End of the world, 20 minutes.

448
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,359
- Better talk quickly, then!
- Amy, I am going to need my car back.

449
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,239
Yes, in a bit.
Now go and have coffee.

450
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,519
Right, yes.

451
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,999
Catch.

452
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,999
I'm the Doctor.

453
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,759
I'm a time traveller.

454
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,319
Everything I told you
1 2 years ago is true. I'm real.

455
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,319
What's happening in the sky is real,
and if you don't let me go now,

456
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,799
everything you've ever known is over.

457
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,919
- I don't believe you.
- Just 20 minutes.

458
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,319
Just believe me for 20 minutes.

459
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,119
Look at it.
Fresh as the day you gave it to me.

460
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,879
And you know it's the same one.

461
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,519
Amy...

462
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,119
believe for 20 minutes.

463
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,679
- What do we do?
- Stop that nurse!

464
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,319
The sun's going out, and you're
photographing a man and a dog. Why?

465
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,439
- Amy?
- Hi!

466
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,799
Oh, this is Rory, he's a...friend.

467
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,599
- Boyfriend.
- Kind of boyfriend.

468
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,319
Amy! Man and dog, why?

469
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,079
- Oh, my God, it's him.
- Just answer his question, please.

470
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,759
It's him, though. The Doctor.

471
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,719
- The Raggedy Doctor.
- Yeah, he came back.

472
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,159
- But he was a story. He was a game.
- Man and dog - why? Tell me now.

473
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,319
Sorry. Because he can't be there.

474
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,319
- Because he's in a hospital, in a coma.
- In a hospital, in a coma.

475
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,039
Yeah.

476
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,759
Knew it. Multi-form, you see?

477
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,599
Disguise itself as anything,
but it needs a live feed.

478
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,599
A psychic link with a living
but dormant mind.

479
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,559
Prisoner Zero.

480
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,119
- What, there's a Prisoner Zero too?
- Yes.

481
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,159
See, that ship up there
is scanning this area

482
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,599
for non-terrestrial technology.

483
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,519
And nothing says non-terrestrial
like a sonic screwdriver.

484
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,879
Aargh!

485
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,359
Hey, come back here!

486
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,359
Oi, come back here! Come back!

487
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,239
I think someone's going to notice.
Don't you?

488
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,959
No, no, no, don't do that!

489
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,199
- Look, it's going.
- No, come back, he's here!

490
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,159
Come back! He's here,
Prisoner Zero is here.

491
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,519
Come back, he's here!
Prisoner Zero is...here.

492
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,639
Doctor!

493
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,639
The drain. It just sort of melted
and went down the drain.

494
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,839
- Well, of course it did.
- What do we do now?

495
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,399
It's hiding in human form.
We need to drive it into the open.

496
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,759
No TARDIS, no screwdriver,
1 7 minutes.

497
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,519
Come on, think. Think!

498
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,559
Barney? Barney...

499
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,519
Barney? Can you hear me, Barney?

500
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,799
Barney? Barney?

501
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,639
So that thing,
that hid in my house for 1 2 years?

502
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,919
Multi-forms can live for millennia.
1 2 years is a pit-stop.

503
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,439
So how come you show up on the same day
that lot do, the same minute?

504
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,599
They're looking for him, but followed me.
They saw me through the crack, got a fix.

505
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,399
They're only late cos I am.
Give me your phone.

506
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,479
- How can he be real? He was never real.
- Phone, now, gimme!

507
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,559
He was just a game, we were kids.
You made me dress up as him.

508
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,399
- These photos are all coma patients?
- Yeah.

509
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,919
No, they're all the multi-form.

510
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,199
Eight comas, eight disguises
for Prisoner Zero.

511
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,919
He had a dog.
There's a dog in a coma?

512
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,199
The coma patient dreams
he's walking a dog,

513
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,759
Prisoner Zero gets a dog. Laptop!

514
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,359
Your friend, what was his name?

515
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,399
- Not him, the good-looking one.
- Thanks.

516
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,599
- Jeff.
- Oh, thanks!

517
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,919
He had a laptop in his bag, a laptop.

518
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,799
Big bag, big laptop,
I need Jeff's laptop.

519
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,919
You two, get to the hospital,
get everyone out.

520
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,439
Clear the whole floor.
Phone me when you're done.

521
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,719
- Your car, come on.
- Um...but how can he be here?

522
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,719
How can the Doctor be here?

523
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,839
- Hello! Laptop, gimme!
- No, no, no, no, wait.

524
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,359
- It's fine.
- Hang on!

525
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,159
Give it here.

526
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,879
Blimey! Get a girlfriend, Jeff.

527
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,319
- Gran.
- What are you doing?

528
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,639
The sun's gone wibbly,
so right now,

529
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,079
somewhere out there, there's going
to be a big video conference call.

530
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,479
All the experts in the world panicking
at once, and do you know what they need?

531
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,279
Me. Ah, and here they all are.

532
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:35,479
All the big boys - NASA, Jodrell Bank,
Tokyo Space Centre, Patrick Moore.

533
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,399
- I like Patrick Moore.
- I'll get you his number,

534
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,879
but watch him, he's a devil.

535
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,999
- You can't just hack in on a call.
- Can't I?

536
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,439
Who are you? This is a secure call,
what are you doing?

537
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,879
Hello, I know, you should switch me off.
But before you do, watch this.

538
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,799
- It's here too, I'm getting it.
- Fermat's Theorem, the proof,

539
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,879
and I mean the real one,
never seen before.

540
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,199
Poor old Fermat, got killed in a duel
before he could write it down.

541
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,319
My fault, I slept in.

542
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,799
Oh, and here's an oldie, but a goodie -
why electrons have mass.

543
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,799
And a personal favourite of mine,

544
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,159
faster-than-light travel
with two diagrams and a joke.

545
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,319
Look at your screens.
Whoever I am, I'm a genius.

546
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,279
Look at the sun.
You need all the help you can get.

547
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,399
Fellas, pay attention.

548
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,319
Sir, what are you doing?

549
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,959
I'm writing a computer virus.

550
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,279
Very clever, super-fast,
and a tiny bit alive, but don't let on.

551
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,039
Why am I writing it on a phone?
Never mind, you'll find out.

552
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,879
OK, I'm sending this
to all your computers.

553
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,439
Get everyone who works for you
sending this everywhere.

554
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,079
E-mail, text, Facebook, Bebo, Twitter,
radar dish -

555
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,999
whatever you've got. Any questions?

556
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,799
- Who was your lady friend?
- Patrick, behave!

557
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,799
- What does this virus do?
- It's a reset command, that's all.

558
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,999
It resets counters, gets in the wifi
and resets every counter it can find.

559
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,119
Anything with a chip will default
at zero at exactly the same time.

560
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,119
But, yeah, I could be lying.
Why should you trust me?

561
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,919
I'll let my best man explain.

562
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,639
Jeff...you're my best man.

563
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,759
You what?

564
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,559
Listen to me. In ten minutes,
you're going to be a legend.

565
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,359
In ten minutes, everyone is going to be
offering you any job you want.

566
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,679
But first, you have to be magnificent.

567
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,759
You have to make them trust you
and get them working. This is it, Jeff.

568
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,079
Right here, right now.

569
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,039
This is when you fly.

570
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,959
Today's the day you save the world.

571
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,959
- Why me?
- It's your bedroom.

572
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,839
Now go, go, go.

573
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,399
OK, guys,

574
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,959
let's do this.

575
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,239
Oh, and delete
your internet history.

576
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,199
Something's happened up there,
we can't get through.

577
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,359
Yes, but what's happened?

578
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,719
I don't know. No-one knows.
Phone him.

579
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,399
I'm phoning him.

580
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,159
Doctor? We're at the hospital,
but we can't get through.

581
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,839
Oh!

582
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,119
- What did he say?
- Look in the mirror.

583
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,999
Ha-ha! Uniform!

584
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,479
Are you on your way?

585
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,999
You're going to need a car.

586
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,759
Don't worry.
I've commandeered a vehicle.

587
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,319
Oh, God!

588
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,159
- Officer.
- What happened?

589
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,999
There was a man. A man with a dog.

590
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,799
I think Dr Ramsden's dead.
And the nurses.

591
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,199
- Are you in?
- Yep.

592
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,039
- But so's Prisoner Zero.
- You need to get out of there.

593
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,919
He was so angry.
He kept shouting. And that dog,

594
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,439
the size of that dog,
I swear it was rabid.

595
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,359
And he just went mad,
attacking everyone.

596
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,599
Where did he go, did you see?
Has he gone? We hid in the ladies'.

597
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,479
Oh, I'm getting it wrong again, aren't I?
I'm always doing that.

598
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,439
So many mouths.

599
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,439
Oh, my God!

600
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,519
Amy? Amy, what's happening?

601
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,519
Amy, talk to me!

602
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,639
We're in the coma ward.
But it's here, it's getting in.

603
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,879
- Which window are you?
- What, sorry?

604
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,279
- Which window?
- First floor on the left,

605
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,759
fourth from the end.

606
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,599
Oh, dear. Little Amelia Pond.

607
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,919
I've watched you grow up.

608
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,639
1 2 years, and you never even knew
I was there.

609
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:29,879
Little Amelia Pond,
waiting for her magic Doctor to return.

610
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,959
But not this time, Amelia.

611
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,759
Right! Hello! Am I late?

612
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,919
No, three minutes to go.
So still time.

613
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,519
Time for what...Time Lord?

614
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,999
Take the disguise off.

615
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,439
They'll find you in a heartbeat.
Nobody dies.

616
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,599
The Atraxi will kill me this time.

617
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,759
If I am to die,

618
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,719
let there be fire.

619
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,279
OK. You came to this world
by opening a crack in space and time.

620
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,519
- Do it again - just leave.
- I did not open the crack.

621
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,559
Somebody did.

622
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:26,719
The cracks in the skin of the universe -
don't you know where they came from?

623
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,399
You don't, do you?

624
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,559
The Doctor
in the TARDIS doesn't know.

625
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,919
Doesn't know, doesn't know!

626
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,999
The universe is cracked.

627
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,079
The Pandorica will open.

628
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,119
Silence will fall.

629
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,279
And we're off!

630
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,919
Look at that.

631
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,079
Look at that!

632
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,279
Yeah, I know,
just a clock, whatever.

633
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,479
But do you know
what's happening right now?

634
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,079
In one little bedroom,
my team are working.

635
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,559
Jeff and the world.
And do you know what they're doing?

636
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,359
They're spreading the word
all over the world, quantum fast.

637
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,719
The word is out.

638
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,359
And do you know what the word is?

639
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,519
The word is zero.

640
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,159
Now, me, if I was up
in the sky in a battleship,

641
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,519
monitoring all Earth communications,
I'd take that as a hint.

642
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,759
And if I had a whole battle fleet
surrounding the planet,

643
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,959
I'd be able track a simple
old computer virus to its source

644
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,879
in, what, under a minute?

645
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,119
The source, by the way,

646
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,839
is right here.

647
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,319
Oh! And I think they just found us!

648
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,479
The Atraxi are limited.

649
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,159
While I'm in this form,
they'll still be unable to detect me.

650
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,839
- They've tracked a phone, not me.
- Yeah,

651
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,039
but this is the good bit.
I mean, this is my favourite bit.

652
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,719
Do you know
what this phone is full of?

653
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,639
Pictures of you.

654
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,439
Every form you've learned to take,
right here.

655
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,239
Oh, and being uploaded about now.

656
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,839
And the final score is -
no TARDIS, no screwdriver -

657
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,279
two minutes to spare. Who da man?

658
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,959
Oh, I'm never saying that again. Fine.

659
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,239
Then I shall take a new form.

660
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,159
Oh, stop it, you know you can't.

661
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,279
Takes months to form
that kind of psychic link.

662
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,919
And I've had years.

663
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,999
No! Amy?

664
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,799
You've got to hold on. Amy!

665
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,119
Don't sleep!
You've got to stay awake, please.

666
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,239
Doctor?

667
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,319
Well, that's rubbish.
Who's that supposed to be?

668
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,199
- It's you.
- Me? Is that what I look like?

669
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,919
- You don't know?
- Busy day. Why me, though?

670
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,839
You're linked with her.
Why are you copying me?

671
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,679
I'm not.

672
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,479
Poor Amy Pond.

673
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,759
Still such a child inside.

674
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,759
Dreaming of the magic Doctor
she knows will return to save her.

675
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,399
What a disappointment you've been.

676
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,119
No, she's dreaming about me
cos she can hear me.

677
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,559
Amy, don't just hear me, listen.

678
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,799
Remember the room, the room
in your house you couldn't see?

679
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,799
Remember you went inside?
I tried to stop you, but you did.

680
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,119
You went in the room.

681
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,319
You went inside.

682
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,879
Amy...

683
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,919
dream about what you saw.

684
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,839
No...no... No!

685
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,199
Well done, Prisoner Zero.

686
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,159
A perfect impersonation of yourself.

687
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,839
Prisoner Zero is located.

688
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,879
Prisoner Zero is restrained.

689
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,479
Silence, Doctor.

690
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,839
Silence will fall.

691
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,679
The sun - it's back to normal, right?

692
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,919
That's... That's good, yeah?
That means it's over.

693
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,879
Amy?

694
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,239
- Are you OK? Are you with us?
- What happened?

695
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,359
- He did it. The Doctor did it.
- No, I didn't.

696
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,239
- What are you doing?
- Tracking the signal back.

697
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,839
- Sorry...in advance.
- About what?

698
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,359
The bill.

699
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,319
- Um...
- Oi, I didn't say you could go!

700
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,119
Article 57
of the Shadow Proclamation.

701
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,479
This is a fully established,
level 5 planet,

702
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,559
and you were going to burn it? What?

703
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,279
Did you think no-one was watching?

704
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,359
You lot, back here, now!

705
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,799
OK.

706
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,599
Now I've done it.

707
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,479
Did he just bring them back?

708
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,879
Did he just save the world from aliens
and then bring all the aliens back again?

709
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,799
- Where are you going?
- The roof.

710
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,919
No, hang on.

711
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,759
- What's in here?
- I'm saving the world.

712
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,799
I need a decent shirt.

713
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,959
To hell with the raggedy.

714
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,239
Time to put on a show!

715
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,399
You just summoned aliens back to Earth.

716
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,839
Actual aliens,

717
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,239
deadly aliens,

718
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,839
aliens of death,

719
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,119
and now you're taking your clothes off.

720
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,079
- Amy, he's taking his clothes off.
- Turn your back if it embarrasses you.

721
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,799
Are you stealing clothes now?

722
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,519
Those clothes belong to people, you know.

723
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,679
Are you not going to turn your back?

724
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,919
Nope.

725
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,839
So this was a good idea, was it?
They were leaving.

726
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,199
Leaving is good.
Never coming back is better.

727
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,439
Come on, then!

728
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,919
The Doctor will see you now.

729
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,799
You are not of this world.

730
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,159
No, but I've put a lot of work into it.

731
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,879
Hmm...

732
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,639
I don't know.

733
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,439
What do you think?

734
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,039
Is this world important?

735
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,719
Important?
What's that mean, "important"?

736
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,719
Six billion people live here -
is that important?

737
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,079
Here's a better question.
Is this world a threat to the Atraxi?

738
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,439
Well, come on.
You're monitoring the whole planet.

739
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,239
Is this world a threat?

740
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,479
No.

741
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,599
Are the peoples of this world
guilty of any crime

742
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,839
by the laws of the Atraxi?

743
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,039
No.

744
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,279
OK.

745
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,399
One more. Just one.

746
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,799
Is this world protected?

747
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,879
Because you're not the first lot to come
here. Oh, there have been so many!

748
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,559
And what you've got to ask is...

749
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,559
...what happened to them?

750
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,199
Hello.

751
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,759
I'm the Doctor.

752
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,799
Basically...

753
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,559
...run.

754
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,039
Is that it?

755
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:45,399
Is that them gone for good?
Who were they?

756
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,959
OK!

757
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,879
What have you got for me this time?

758
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,759
Look at you!

759
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,399
Oh, you sexy thing!

760
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,439
Look at you!

761
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,639
Sorry about running off earlier.

762
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,559
Brand-new TARDIS - bit exciting.

763
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,599
Just had a quick hop to the moon
and back to run her in.

764
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,359
She's ready for the big stuff now.

765
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,119
It's you. You came back.

766
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,959
Course I came back.
I always come back.

767
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,359
- Something wrong with that?
- And you kept the clothes.

768
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,239
Well, I just saved the world,
the whole planet,

769
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,519
for about the millionth time,
no charge. Yeah, shoot me!

770
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,479
- I kept the clothes.
- Including the bow tie.

771
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,679
- Yeah, it's cool. Bow ties are cool.
- Are you from another planet?

772
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,239
- Yeah.
- OK.

773
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,679
So what do you think?

774
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,679
- Of what?
- Other planets. Want to check some out?

775
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,119
- What does that mean?
- It means...

776
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,199
Well, it means...come with me.

777
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,959
Where?

778
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,559
Wherever you like.

779
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,639
All that stuff - the hospital,
the spaceships, Prisoner Zero...

780
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,119
Oh, don't worry. That's just
the beginning. There's loads more.

781
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:29,519
Yeah, but those things, those...
amazing things, all that stuff...

782
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,599
- ...that was two years ago!
- Oh-oh!

783
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,279
- Oops.
- Yeah.

784
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,999
- So that's...
- 1 4 years!

785
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,999
1 4 years since fish custard.

786
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,359
Amy Pond, the girl who waited,
you've waited long enough.

787
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,439
When I was a kid, you said there was
a swimming pool and a library,

788
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,919
- and the pool was in the library.
- Yeah.

789
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,839
Not sure where it is now. So...coming?

790
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,359
No.

791
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,439
- You wanted to come 1 4 years ago.
- I grew up.

792
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,199
Don't worry.

793
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,759
I'll soon fix that.

794
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,599
Well?

795
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,039
Anything you want to say?
Any passing remarks?

796
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,439
I've heard them all.

797
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,679
I'm in my nightie.

798
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,039
Oh, don't worry.
Plenty of clothes in the wardrobe.

799
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,199
And possibly a swimming pool.

800
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,359
So...all of time and space,

801
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,519
everything that ever happened
or ever will...

802
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,199
Where do you want to start?

803
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,879
You are so sure that I'm coming.

804
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,039
- Yeah, I am.
- Why?

805
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,439
Cos you're the Scottish girl
in the English village,

806
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,879
- and I know how that feels.
- Oh, do you?

807
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,719
All these years living here,
most of your life...

808
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,879
and you've still got that accent.
Yeah, you're coming.

809
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,239
- Can I be back by tomorrow morning?
- It's a time machine.

810
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,599
You can be back five minutes ago.
Why, what's tomorrow?

811
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,719
Nothing. Nothing. Just...you know, stuff.

812
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,959
All right, then.
Back in time for "stuff".

813
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,719
Oh! A new one!

814
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,639
Lovely.

815
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,319
Thanks, dear!

816
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,879
Why me?

817
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,879
- Why not?
- Seriously. You are asking me

818
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,879
to run away with you
in the middle of the night.

819
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,479
It's a fair question. Why me?

820
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,999
- I don't know. Fun. Do I need a reason? -
People always have a reason.

821
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,479
- Do I look like people?
- Yes.

822
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,719
Been knocking around
on my own for a while.

823
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,719
My choice. But I've started talking
to myself. It's giving me earache.

824
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:33,799
- You're lonely. That's it? Just that?
- Just that.

825
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,079
Promise.

826
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,759
OK.

827
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,799
So, are you OK, then?

828
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,359
Cos this place, sometimes
it can make people feel a bit...

829
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,519
- you know...
- I'm fine.

830
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,799
It's just...there's a whole world in here,
just like you said.

831
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,799
It's all true. I thought...
Well, I started to think that maybe

832
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,239
- you were just like a madman with a box.
- Amy Pond,

833
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:04,559
there's something you'd better understand,
cos one day your life may depend on it.

834
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,599
I am definitely a madman with a box.

835
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,919
Ha-ha! Yeah.

836
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,919
Goodbye, Leadworth.
Hello, everything!

837
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,879
Whoo!

838
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,079
Ha-ha!
